# HELIUS metabolomics - fMet project

## Introduction
This repository describes the analyses for the HELIUS metabolomics / fMet project.

## Overview scripts
1. Data cleaning HELIUS data
2. Descriptives (table 1)
3. Machine learning (XGBoost) models: creating model input tables, running models
4. Processing ML results: top predictors and explained variance
5. Linear regression models: all subjects and stratified for ethnicity
6. Correlations between fMet and nitric oxide pathway metabolites
7. Dietary intake analysis 
8. ETANASH: effect gut microbiota on fMet levels (before and after antibiotics)
9. Validation cohorts: forest plots of results from validation cohorts

## Assets folder
In this folder, you can find a functions file (predominantly used for the processing of ML results), a conda yaml for the XGBoost ML environment, and an instruction for setting up the XGBoost env. 

## Reference to paper
This paper is unpublished. A reference will follow when the paper can be found online.
